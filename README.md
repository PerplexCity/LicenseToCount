# License To Count

Not too much data manipulation this week. Original info is simply the ten license plates which were manually logged. You can manually create ten permutations or automate it. Either way, taking the estimate at each step for ten permutations is expressed in the licperm.csv.

Creating both graphics is pretty straightforward using the NYPD_lic.R script in R Studio.

Full disclosure: I didn't have a lot of time to clean up the files/code this week to make it super consumable. If you happen to take a look and are confused/skeptical, please just let me know!
